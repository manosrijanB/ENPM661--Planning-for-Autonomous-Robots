# 8 puzzle solver using BFS algorithm

## You can run `BFS.py` 
- taken test case 2 for intial state which is
- Initial state -  [4,7,0],
                 [1,2,8],
                 [3,5,6]

- Goal states is   [1,4,7],
                 [2,5,8],
                 [3,6,0]

- one can change the start and goal in lines in 86 and 90 to desire new values to find Solution and details will be saved to nodes.tx, nodesinfo.txt,and nodespath.txt.
